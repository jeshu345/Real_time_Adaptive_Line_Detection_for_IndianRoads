# Real_time_Adaptive_Line_Detection_for_IndianRoads

Lane Detection System | Computer Vision Project

Designed and implemented a lane detection pipeline using Python and OpenCV to identify road lane markings from image and video data.

Applied image preprocessing techniques including grayscale conversion, Gaussian blurring, Canny edge detection, and region-of-interest masking.

Utilized Hough Transform to detect lane lines and overlaid results on original frames for real-time visualization.

Improved detection accuracy by handling noise, varying lighting conditions, and curved lanes.

Demonstrated practical application of computer vision concepts relevant to autonomous driving systems.

Technologies: Python, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook
